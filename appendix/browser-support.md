# Browser Support

We are committed to making Web Native and the Fission platform work on desktop and mobile browsers without plugins. This is the list of browsers we aim to support.

Alternative browsers \(e.g. Brave\) are supported on a best effort basis.

## Desktop

### Windows

* Chrome
* Firefox

### MacOS

* Safari
* Chrome
* Firefox

### Linux

* Chrome
* Firefox

## Mobile

### Safari on iPhone iOS / iPad iPadOS

Embedded Webviews in apps may or may not work, as it does differ from Safari.

### Chrome on Android

### Firefox on Android
