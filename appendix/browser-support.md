# Browser Support

We are committed to making Web Native and the Fission platform work on desktop and mobile browsers without plugins. This is the list of browsers we aim to support.

Alternative browsers \(e.g. Brave, Microsoft Edge\) are supported on a best effort basis.

{% hint style="info" %}
Gmail's guidance on [browsers they support](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6557) states "works best in the newest and last prior version of these browsers", which is also what we'll be aiming for.
