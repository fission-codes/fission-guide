# Dashboard

{% hint style="danger" %}
We're filling out new information here ahead of publishing our dashboard, so links may change or not be live yet. A development alpha version is at [https://dashboard-develop.fission.app/](https://dashboard-develop.fission.app/)
{% endhint %}

Like all Fission apps -- including the ones made by Fission directly -- you need to give permission to the Dashboard app to access your account info.

The first account management feature in the Dashboard is to show the verification status of your account, and to resend your verification email if it ended up in your spam.
