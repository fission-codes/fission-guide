# Getting Started

## Setup

Now that you have `fission` installed, you need to set it up for your local machine. If this is your first time using fission or you are setting up a new machine, you'll want to run setup:

```bash
$ fission setup
Username: YOURNAME
Email: yourname@example.com
‚úÖ Registration successful!
```

And you're good to go! A private key has been generated for your machine, and placed in your local `~/ssh` folder. This secures communication with the Fission services, and works similarly to how using an SSH key to connect to GitHub works.

Note: account linking is not yet live, but will be very soon. You can rename your fission key or securely copy it around as workaround for now.
{% endhint %}

### Account Linking

If you already have an account, you'll want to link it to your local system. Just enter in your current username and [follow the linking flow](account-linking.md).

## Create a simple webpage

Let's create a simple website and make it interplanetary!

Create a project directory and add an `index.html` file:

```bash
$ mkdir hello-universe
$ cd hello-universe
$ touch index.html
```

Use the `fission app-init` command to create a new app in the current directory. Find out more on the [Fission CLI page ¬ª](cli/)

```text
‚úÖ App initialized as junior-angular-tulip.fission.app
‚èØÔ∏è  Next run fission up or fission watch to sync data
üíÅ It may take DNS time to propogate this initial setup globally. 
In this case, you can always view your app 
at https://ipfs.runfission.com/ipns/junior-angular-tulip.fission.app
```

Add some content to `index.html`:

{% code title="index.html" %}
```markup
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello Universe!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello Universe!</h1>
    <p>This is a Fission powered page.</p>
    <p>Assisted by <a href="https://fission.codes">Fission</a>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
{% endcode %}

## Run IPFS

You need IPFS running in order to use `fission` 

If you're using [ipfs-desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop), ensure that the application is running.

Using Homebrew, ipfs can be running continuously in the background using the following command:

```text
brew services start ipfs
```

If you're running `ipfs` on another Linux system, run the following in a separate terminal:

```bash
$ ipfs daemon
```

## Go interplanetary!

Make sure you're in your project folder \(`hello-universe`\) and run:

```bash
$ fission up
üöÄ Now live on the network
üëå QmPmZDd6esqzsc2R1i8t5DcRGeRKrNomMhqj232Cz6heNW
üìù DNS Updated. Check out your site at:
üîó diffusiondemo.fission.name
```

Copy the url from the last line, and paste it into your web browser to see your new site, hosted on the decentralized web. It's that easy!

_Note: It may take some time for DNS to propagate. So give it a minute or two if it doesn't load immediately. If you're impatient you can also take the `content-id` from the CLI output and view it here at `https://ipfs.runfission.com/ipfs/{YOUR_CONTENT_ID}`_

{% hint style="success" %}
Fun IPFS Fact: If everyone follows this tutorial exactly you will end up with identical Content ID's. This means you can instantly pull the demo website from your neighbour if they're a step ahead of you.
