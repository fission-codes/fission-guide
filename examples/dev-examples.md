# Developer Examples

We're developing a series of example apps, base templates, and code examples to help you get up to speed in building Fission-powered apps. The [forum's app ideas section](https://talk.fission.codes/c/developers/app-ideas/11) is also a great place to look for inspiration.

### Elm

[Walk through an example using elm-pages](elm/publishing-an-elm-pages-app.md) that goes from basic publishing through to adding auth and storage.

The Quotes app is a simple app written in Elm. It features Fission login, and stores quotes data in your personal storage.

* Try it live at [quotes.fission.app](https://quotes.fission.app)
* Browse the source on Github [icidasset/quotes](https://github.com/icidasset/quotes) 

Fission Drive is maintained by the Fission team and included with every Fission account. It lets you work with all of the files in your account's file system.

* Read more about [Drive in the Guide Â»](https://guide.fission.codes/drive)

* Browse the source on Github [fission-suite/drive](https://github.com/fission-suite/drive)

### WebAssembly

[An example that uses "plain" JavaScript without a framework](../webassembly/storing-webassembly-modules.md), and also teaches you about using WebAssembly.

### React
