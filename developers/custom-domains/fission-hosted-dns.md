# Fission Hosted DNS

We can take care of this for you by hosting your DNS for you. This means changing your name servers to the Fission ones. Below are guides for some DNS providers.

### Fission Nameservers

* ns1.fission.systems
* ns2.fission.systems
* ns3.fission.systems
* ns4.fission.systems

Once this is completed, we'll confirm it and handle any other updates needed automatically.

## Changing Nameservers in Namecheap

Go to the domain you want to host on Fission in your Namecheap admin:

 Where it says "Namecheap BasicDNS", select "Custom DNS" from the drop down:

Enter in `ns1.fission.systems` and `ns2.fission.systems` and click the green check mark to save.
