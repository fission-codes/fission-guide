# Webnative SDK

The webnative software development kit offers tools for:

* **Auth.** Users make an account and link their account across devices in the [Fission Auth Lobby](https://auth.fission.codes).
* **Storage.** The webnative file system \(WNFS\) stores user data for apps.
* **UCAN and DID tools** for working with UCANs and distributed identities
* **Platform APIs** for interacting with user apps

**Versions.** This guide is versioned for each version of the CLI/Webnative SDK. See the top left above Overview in the sidebar to select the version of CLI or SDK you are working with. Latest represents all versions newer that last numbered version. We will always add a numbered version when a breaking change occurs.
