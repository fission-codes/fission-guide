# Webnative SDK

The Webnative SDK empowers developers to build fully distributed web applications without needing a complex back-end. Webnative provides:

* **User accounts** using the browser's [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web\_Crypto\_API) or a blockchain wallet using the [Webnative WalletAuth plugin](https://github.com/fission-codes/webnative-walletauth)
* **Authorization** using [UCAN](https://ucan.xyz/)
* **Encrypted file storage** using the [Webnative File System](./) backed by [IPLD](https://ipld.io/)
* **Key management** using the [AWAKE protocol](https://github.com/ucan-wg/awake) to link devices
* **Platform APIs** for publishing apps from the browser

Webnative applications work offline and store data encrypted for the user by leveraging the power of the web platform.&#x20;

This guide walks through the fundamental concepts for working with the Webnative SDK. We also publish an API reference at [webnative.fission.app](https://webnative.fission.app) and you can view [the code](https://github.com/fission-codes/webnative) on GitHub.
