# Managing Your Account

Use the `fission user` command and its subcommands to set up your account and display your username.

## Register a new user

The `fission user register` command registers your account with Fission or links to your existing Fission account.

```text
$ fission user register
Username: YOURNAME
Email: yourname@example.com
âœ… Registration successful!
```

When you register a new account, you will be prompted for a username and an email. Fission will send you an email to confirm your account and complete your registration.

The `fission user register` command will create a global `config.yaml` file in your `~/.config/fission` directory. See the [Global Fission YAML](fission-yaml.md#global-fission-yaml) guide for more information about the `config.yaml` file.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `fission setup` command is a shortcut for `fission user register`.
{% endhint %}

The registration process will also create a [Fission Drive](../../drive/preview.md) for you automatically at the URL `USERNAME.fission.name` using your Fission username.

## Display user information

Use `fission user whoami` to display your username.

```text
$ fission user whoami
ðŸ’» Currently logged in as: fission
```
